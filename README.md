Improvements
------------
Photopile JS is still a pretty basic gallery. Wish list for future improvements includes:

* Improved navigation
 * Clearly indicated 'close' button in photo container
* Display alt tags as photo description when a photo is picked up
* Improved cross-browser support
* Improved performance when user quick-clicks multiple thumbnails before they are viewed
